            What is a bug-out-bag (B.O.B.)?
          </h1>
          <p class="text-wht">
            The concept of a bug-out-bag or B.O.B. for short—is to have pre-stocked supplies ready to go in case of natural disaster or emergency to last one for 72 hours. The idea is to be able to enough supplies to get to away from a disasters and to a safer place. Depending on the circumstance some bags are prepared to a shorter time typically 24 hours or in some cases up to 6 months.

            The most important part of a BOB is to have it ready when you need it. No matter how unlikely an armageddon or zombie apocalypse is there is always a chance for emergency to occur that where you’ll need to get out of your home quickly.</p>
          <h1 class="text-orange">
            Keep it where you can find it.
          </h1>
          <p>
            BOBs should be kept in a place that is easily accessible so you and anyone you live with can quickly grab it and run out the door. This place should be thought and part of a larger emergency evacuation plan. Some common places are near exits in your house—a pantry near the garage are great since they are designed to store goods in already or even a coat closets which are often right next to a front door.</p>

            Just like an emergency plans, BOB should be customize for where you live.

          <p class="text-wht">
            What you pack in your bag should be created with the evirnment and location you live in mind. Someone who living in Alaska in the winter will have different natural resources available and need to dress differently then someone living in the Arizona dessert.

            There are definitely some must-have items in a BOB but decisions as to what goes in it and how much also depends on you as person. Everyone is different but remember this is meant to help you survive. The main thing is weight, if your bag is too heavy it can be dangerous. A bag should weigh no more than 25% of your overall body weight.
