            What is a bug-out-bag (B.O.B.)?
          </h1>
          <p class="text-wht">
            The concept of a bug-out-bag or B.O.B. for short—is to have pre-stocked supplies ready to go in case of natural disaster or emergency to last one for 72 hours. The idea is to be able to enough supplies to get to away from a disasters and to a safer place. Depending on the circumstance some bags are prepared to a shorter time typically 24 hours or in some cases up to 6 months.

            The most important part of a BOB is to have it ready when you need it. No matter how unlikely an armageddon or zombie apocalypse is there is always a chance for emergency to occur that where you’ll need to get out of your home quickly.</p>

            Keep it where you can find it.
          </h1>
          <p>
            BOBs should be kept in a place that is easily accessible so you and anyone you live with can quickly grab it and run out the door. This place should be thought and part of a larger emergency evacuation plan. Some common places are near exits in your house—a pantry near the garage are great since they are designed to store goods in already or even a coat closets which are often right next to a front door.</p>
