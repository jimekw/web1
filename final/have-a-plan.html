              <p>
                While overall earthquakes in the U.S. have been minimal, states like California that a fault line see earthquakes fairly regularly.

                For many cities that are built on former flood plain—floods are a likely possibility that one should prepare for. If you live in a high risk floor area you should take basic swim lessons and make sure you have boots and waders so you can move in waist high water.
